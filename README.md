# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the required packages.
2.Display the values predicted using scatter plot and predict. 
3.Plot the graph according to the given input.
4.End the program 

## Program:
```
